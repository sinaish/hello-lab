# hello-lab

Hello,

I'm a SLIS student at Simmons University taking a course on web development and information architecture. For this course I've decided to venture into the world of git and learn how to use it for creating websites.

This is my first lab where I used git to edit the files and push onto Github. It's a simple web page with a poem.

I'm writing this readme just in case somebody stumbles upon this repository. If you want, you can branch out and edit the CSS however you'd like. I'd like to see what cool stuff you come up with.

Regards,

Sinai
